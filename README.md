Since I recently made a compiler, I thought I would do another one in Rust so I can learn Rust. This will give me more 
experience with some new languages, as well as having even more experience working on lower level code and understanding
the inner workings of a lot of langauge specific things. 

I am following this guide on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAU51Dqsp3Y&list=PLI1h1vRqlHLNZAa2BEM9uZ2GEvUNYDasO

I dont know how in depth I wil go because I want to work on other projects as well, but hopefully this is a nice
intro to rust!
